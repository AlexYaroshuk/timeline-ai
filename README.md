# Text to Timeline Generator

This project is a powerful tool that uses OpenAI to generate a timeline of events from a given text. It's designed to help users visualize the sequence of events in a text in a more structured and understandable way.

## How it Works

The project works by taking a text input from the user. It then sends this text to OpenAI, which processes the text and identifies the events within it. These events are then returned to our application, which organizes them into a timeline format for easy viewing and understanding.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Users can input any text they want to generate a timeline from.
- **OpenAI Integration**: The application uses OpenAI to process the text and identify events.
- **Timeline Generation**: The application organizes the events identified by OpenAI into a timeline.

## Usage

To use the application, simply input your text into the text box and click the 'Generate Timeline' button. If the text box is empty or the application is currently processing a request, the button will be disabled and its color will be dimmer.

## Future Improvements

We're constantly working to improve the application and add new features. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to share them with us.
